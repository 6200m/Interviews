# Interviews
This repo contains a list of interviews scraped from the Internet Archives (or from Nintendo's website) with the developers of various Wii and DS software, to help preserve information that could possibly benefit others in the future.

RiiConnect24 will not be editing these in any way, except for removing Archive JS scripts, and potentially fixing a few links. This means that most of the links could be outdated or broken.
