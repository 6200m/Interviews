# Interviews
This repo contains a list of interviews scraped from the Internet Archive Wayback Machine (or from Nintendo's website) with the developers of various Wii and DS software to help preserve information that could possibly benefit others in the future.

RiiConnect24 will not be editing these in any way, except to remove extraneous Wayback Machine markup and occasionally to fix some links. However most of the links may be outdated or broken - your mileage may vary.

All content, including images, are copyright of Nintendo except where otherwise stated.
